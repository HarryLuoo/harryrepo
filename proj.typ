* Lampreys: The Bachelorettes of Lake Michigan* #h(1fr) Feb 2024 \
*Group project for #link("https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm")[_COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling_]*\
- Collaborated on a team to model the food web of Lake Michigan with a focus on the population dynamics of invasive sea lampreys
- Innovated beyond traditional models by developing a demographic projection matrix to simulate lamprey population cycles and food-dependent sex ratios, enhancing the Lotka-Volterra Model.
- Honed skills in teamwork, scientific communication, and simulation development, applying dynamics systems, matix algebra and numerical analysis concepts to real-world ecological problems.
